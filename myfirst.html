   <p>Tomorrow's greatest leaders are those with the courage to face reality and help the people around them face reality.
    There is nothing so powerful as truth - and often nothing so strange.
    Accept everything about yourself - I mean everything.

   <p>Always stand up for Truth regardless of who steps on it. Silence is the most expensive to buy. You win a debate with a better argument, not by force. When insulted by injustice, face it, stand up against it and demand your right and justice.</p>
